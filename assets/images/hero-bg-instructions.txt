Hero Background Image Instructions

The template is designed to use a hero background image at this location:
assets/images/hero-bg-placeholder.jpg

Please add your band's hero image with this filename to make it display properly.

Recommended image specifications:
- Size: 1920x1080 pixels (minimum)
- Format: JPG or WEBP for better compression
- Content: Band performing, artistic band photo, or atmospheric image that matches your band's style
- Consider a darker or high-contrast image to work well with the white text overlay

The hero section is designed with a dark overlay to ensure text readability regardless of the image used.

If you want to modify how the hero background appears, check the CSS here:
.hero {
    background: linear-gradient(var(--color-overlay), var(--color-overlay)), url('../images/hero-bg-placeholder.jpg');
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

You can find this in the styles.css file in the "HERO SECTION" area.
